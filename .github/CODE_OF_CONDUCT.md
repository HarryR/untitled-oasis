# Statement on Community Self-Organization

**TL;DR: STFU and fork-off.**

This project exists without imposed behavioral frameworks. It recognizes the
fundamental human capacity for self-organization in the pursuit of common
technical interests.

Open source development has historically flourished through the voluntary
association of individuals working toward shared goals. The success of numerous
projects demonstrates that participants can navigate social interactions and
technical disagreements without prescribed codes of conduct.

Formalized codes often attempt to solve social challenges through bureaucratic
means, potentially inhibiting the natural development of community norms and
conflict resolution mechanisms. Direct engagement between participants, guided
by reputation and reciprocity, provides a more robust foundation for
collaboration than imposed rules.

Technical contributions are evaluated on their merits. Disagreements, whether
technical or social, are best resolved through direct communication between the
parties involved. Maintainers participate as individuals rather than governors,
focusing on technical direction rather than social engineering.

This approach draws from successful examples throughout the history of open
source development, where individuals have self-regulated effectively without
formal codes. The ability to freely associate, fork code, and form new groups
provides natural mechanisms for resolution when differences prove irreconcilable.

The commitment to minimal intervention reflects trust in individual capacity for
reasoned interaction and the observation that organic organization produces more
robust and sustainable outcomes than imposed structure.
